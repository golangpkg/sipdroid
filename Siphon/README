Introduction
============

Siphon SIP-VoIP project is the first in his category that works both on iPhone 
and iPod Touch. It is a native application approved running on OSX 1.1.1 - 1.1.3 
using the Microphone built-in and the headset, and an external Microphone (for 
example, designed by the Touchmods team) for the iPod Touch.

The Application supports the SIP standard, preserving compatibility with 
hundreds of SIP providers and offers a GUI which preserves the apple design of 
native iPhone and iPod Touch applications.

Compilation
===========

 PJSIP
 =====
 To compile Siphon, you need headers and static libraries of pjsip.
 You can download on http://pjsip.org/
 For the momennt, I don't release the media layer for ipod and iphone, so you 
 need to configure with this line :
   ./aconfigure --host=arm-apple-darwin --disable-speex-codec \
   --disable-speex-aec --disable-sound
 
 Like that, the media layer uses null sound. So you will be able to compile 
 Siphon, but you won't be able to talk and hear your callee.
 
 You can find implementation of pjmedia for ipod touch at :
 	http://code.google.com/p/siphon/downloads/list
