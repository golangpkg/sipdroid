<p><b>Siphon 4 iPod Touch</b></p>
<br /><br/>
<p>Siphon SIP/VoIP project is the first in his category that works both on iPhone and iPod Touch. It is a native application approved running on OSX 1.1.1 - 1.1.4 using the Microphone built-in headset, and an external Microphone (for example, designed by the Touchmods team) for the iPod Touch.</p>

<p>The Application supports the SIP standard, preserving compatibility with hundreds of SIP providers and offers a GUI which preserves the apple design of native iPhone and iPod Touch applications.</p>
