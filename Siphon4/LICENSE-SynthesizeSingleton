   - Moved the swizzle code to allocWithZone so that non-default init methods may be
     used to initialize the singleton.
   - Added "lesser" singleton which allows other instances besides sharedInstance to be created.
   - Added guard ifndef so that this file can be used in multiple library distributions.
   - Made singleton variable name class-specific so that it can be used on multiple classes
     within the same compilation module.

   This version of Matt's code uses method_setImplementaiton() to dynamically
   replace the +sharedInstance method with one that does not use @synchronized
